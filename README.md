## Overview
Group data sprint analysing the U.S. wind energy market for an investment-style case. The goal was to summarise market structure and identify where opportunities are concentrated, focusing on:
- Market growth over time
- OEM (manufacturer) concentration and supply-chain implications
- Operator landscape (wind specialists vs diversified utilities)
- Geographic hotspots to prioritise diligence and capital allocation

## Key Takeaways
- U.S. wind capacity scaled rapidly post-2005, reaching **130+ GW installed** in our analysis.
- The turbine supply chain is highly concentrated: **GE, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa** account for the majority of installed capacity (~90% in our analysis).
- Projects are geographically clustered, with strong concentration in **Texas and the Midwest**, creating clear regional focus areas.
- The operator landscape mixes **pure-play wind** operators and **legacy utilities** with partial wind exposure.

## Recommendations
- Prioritise investment screening in the highest-density regions (Texas/Midwest) where scale and deal flow are strongest.
- When assessing operators, differentiate between:
  - **High wind exposure** (more direct thesis alignment)
  - **Diversified utilities** (potentially lower risk but diluted wind impact)
- Factor OEM concentration into diligence (pricing power, lead times, component constraints).
